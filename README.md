## Quickstart

**Install System Dependencies:**

First, install NodeJS 10.x.  We recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) version manager for this.

```bash
$ nvm install v10
$ nvm alias default v10
```

Now, you'll want to install yarn.

```
$ brew install yarn
```

**Install Project Dependencies:**

Now, install the node dependencies by running this.

```bash
$ yarn install
```

**Run the Server:**

```bash
$ yarn run server
```
